## Technologies
- Express
- MongoD
- Mongoose 
- Node.js

## Approach
#### Set-Up
When setting up, I knew I would be utilizing multiple different technologies, so I pre-emptively installed them all. This included doing an npm init for the folder, and then doing an install of Express, EJS, Mongoose, Mongo and Method-Override. This set me up for success with all basic files being installed properly. I then went through and created my folders, Models (for my Schema), Public (for my CSS files), Views (for my CRUD EJS files) and of course my server.js file in my main folder. 

#### The Code
I began in my server.js file, and started making the routes that I knew I wanted to have. In order to create CRUD/7 RESTful Routes, I knew I would need to have routes directing to my new.ejs, show.ejs, index.ejs and edit.ejs along with Put, Post and Delete Routes. As I created each route, I went to the associated EJS file and filled in the proper information, as I've been taught throughout all of the reps in General Assembly WDIR. I found this portion to be quite obtainable and easy. Issues arose within my code: 
[] Edit Route
[] Delete Route
[] Show Route 

### Styling
Before doing any CSS, I knew that I would want to reach a stretch goal of utilizing Partials, at least for Header items. 

## Unsolved Problems
Originally, I wanted to create a log-in feature where users could log-in and see the pets that they own, and message other pet owners for advice. As of Monday, I have yet to obtain that functionality, but will continue working with the TA in order to achieve success.
